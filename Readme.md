# WILL-POWER

## Reminders

- Back end and front end are two separate npm packages
- We use `stable` branch for deployment. We will include the ready-for-production front end in the `back_end/dist` of `stable` branch. Always make sure that `back_end/dist` is up to date before deploying. Any other branches shouldn't touch `back_end/dist`
