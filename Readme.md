# WILL-POWER

- Back end and front end are two separate npm packages
- Master branch is for deployment. We will include the ready-for-production front end in the **back_end/public**. Make sure that **back_end/public** is up to date before deploying. Feature branches shouldn't touch **back_end/public**
